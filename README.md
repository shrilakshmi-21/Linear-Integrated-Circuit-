## AIM
Analyse the CS Amplifier and extract the parameters: DC Operating point, DC analysis, gain, bandwidth, power 

## SPECIFICATIONS
180nm, tsmc, VDD=1.8V, Power budget=50uW

## COMPONENTS REQUIRED
Resistor(1Kohm), NMOS, DC power supply

## TASK 1
## PROCEDURE
1. Set VDD=1.8V, input voltage as 0.9V.
2. Connect the resitor(1kohm) to the drain of the NMOS and make the source as ground.
3. Set the width and length of the NMOS to get the required current.
4. Give the appropriate values so as to get the DC, Transient and AC analysis.
5. Extract the required parameters.

## ANALYSIS
For the given specification we have to ensure that the MOSFET operates in saturation region and obtain the current as 27.77uA.
So to get the required current, the obtained length and width of the MOSFET is 500nm and 487nm respectively.
Fig 1.1 shows the DC anlaysis part of the circuit.
